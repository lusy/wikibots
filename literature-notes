--> scrutinise effectiveness and legitimacy of algorithmic governance systems
--> propose a framework for researching these
--> "detailed map of key research themes, questions and methods" <-- vgl Latour
"The workshop brought together a multidisciplinary group of scholars to consider
(a) barriers to legitimate and effective algorithmic governance and
(b) the research methods needed to address the nature and impact of specific barriers."
--> "longer historical trend towards the mechanisation of governance"
--> "The systems we consider in this paper and
that we considered at our workshop are different from
their historical forebears. The differences are largely a
matter of degree and not of type."

top-down vs bottom-up algorithms: machine learning as an example of bottom-up: problem: lack of transparency, incorporated into already opaque governance structures

"Participants also suggested that we identify capacity-
related problems by analysing existing code and cate-
gorizing errors that emerge from this code according to
whether they are ‘technical’ or ‘legal’ in nature."
