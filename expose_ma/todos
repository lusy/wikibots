# TODOs

* Read Code and other Laws of Cyberspace // code would indeed be law if bots implement something else than anyone wanted which turns to be the status quo
* Begin with a story (or several) in the similar fashion as Geiger's introductory vignettes
* Read through Marcela's literature

# Notes on tools/stuff that may be useful
